jQuery 
===

Javascript is a complicated language and the environment of the
browser is also complicated and can be hard to understand. Because of this, 
there have been many tool-kits and libraries developed to simplify 
one or other part of the task of writing applications in Javascript. 
Some of these took-kits take a very opinionated view of how you should
write applications and provide a rich framework for the developer to
work in.  They can be quite powerful but they also have a steep learning
curve.  

This text and the course it supports is intended to teach you about how 
the technology of the web works and how things fit together to make
web applications.  From this perspective, we want to see how Javascript
interacts with the DOM within the browser and how it responds to events
to build an interactive application interface.  Using a high level tool-kit
hides a lot of the detail from the developer (for good reason)
