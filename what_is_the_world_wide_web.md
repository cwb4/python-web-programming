## What is the World Wide Web? {#what-is-the-world-wide-web}

Perhaps the first thing to establish in our discussion of the web is what exactly it is. This chapter will look in brief overview at the core technologies that go together to make the World Wide Web.

We can start by differentiating the Internet and the World Wide Web. These are often confused because the Web is the main use that most people have for the Internet and a common web browser is called &quot;Internet Explorer&quot;. However, we can properly distinguish between them. The Internet is a collection of inter-connected computers using the TCP/IP protocol to exchange information. The World Wide Web is a particular use of the Internet to exchange HTML web pages (and other documents) using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).

Let&#039;s look briefly at the four basic ingredients of the Web:

*   TCP/IP - is a low level message protocol that is used to transfer messages between computers on the Internet.
*   HTTP - is used by a Web Client to make a request to a Web Server and for the server to return the response.
*   URL - is a way of writing down the address of something on the Web so that a browser can work out where to get it from.
*   HTML - is a language for writing web pages containing text, images and other content.

Together, these four technologies allow a web client - the web browser on your computer - to fetch pages from a web server anywhere in the world that might contain links to other documents and so on. It&#039;s the links between documents that make this a _Web_ and the Internet that allows it to be the _World Wide Web_.

Let&#039;s look at each of these technologies in a little more detail; although we&#039;ll explore most of them a lot more throughout the rest of this book.
